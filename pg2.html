<h1>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</h1><br>
	<hr style= "color:gold;">
		
<h2>2.0 <br>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<hr>
	
	
<div>
		
<p>This chapter is consistient with the objectives of the study,the review is not merely a narrative summary of different<br>
 authors but rather an analysis of what is known so far and related trends and development in the areas of Protected Areas and Rural Livelihoods Interlinkages.<br>
 </p>
 
</div>
 <br>
 <h2>2.1 <br>Conceptual Framework</h2>
 <br><br>
 	
 <img src="/images/SLA.jpg" alt="Sustainable Livelihood Framework" width="100%" height="80%"> 
  
 <div>	<p>
The sustainable livelihood framework is  a tool that is used to improve people's livelihood particularly.  <br>
The livelihood of the rural poor it was developed over a period of several months  the sustainable livelihoods advisory committee , building on earlier works by The Institute of development studies. <br>
The sustainable livelihood framework DF ID 1998 the main factors that affects people's livelihood and  typical relationships between these . Can be used in both planning new  <br><br>
development activities assessing the contribution to livelihood sustainability made by existing activities in particular provides a checklist important issues and sketches out the Way <br>
  these links to each other , </p>
<br><br>
  	</div>
  	

<hr>
<div>
<p>Draws attention to core influences and processes and Emphasizes the multiple interactions between the various which affects livelihoods .<br>
The SLA  people is  people's centered and does not work in a linear manner .The SLA does not claim to present a perfect model of reality  - it primary purpose is  to help stakeholders with different<br>
 perspective to engage in structured and coherent debate about the many factors that affect livelihoods their relative importance and the way in which they interact .This in turns , should help <br>
in identification of appropriate entry points for support of rural livelihoods ( Robert Chambers ) <br> 
 </p>
 
<p>Therefore people-centered analysis is most likely to begin with simultaneous investigation of people's assets , their objectives ( the rural rural livelihood outcomes which they are seeking and the  strategies which they adopts to achieve these objectives.<br>
Important feedback is likely between :<br>

<p>B. Livelihoods outcome and Livelihoods assets for example if it has other been show that if people  feel less vulnerable they frequently choose to have fewer Children.This has implications for population trends which might be an important part of the vulnerability context .
<br><hr>
	</p>
	
<div>
The framework should be adopted to meet the needs of any given circumstance.The arrows within the framework are used as a short hand to denote a variety of different types of relationship s all of which are dynamic.None of the arrows imply direct causality though all imply a certain level of influence.<br>


<hr style= "color:gold;">
<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE FRAMEWORK TO HELP ELIMINATE POVERTY </h2>

<div>
 <p>The framework summaries the main components of and influences on Rural Livelihoods; it does not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the issues to be considered.It should be adapted to meet the needs of any given circumstance.<br>
Rural Livelihoods are dynamic,complex,integrated and local.("Whose Reality Counts ",Chambers)<br>
</p>
</div>

<h2>Vulnerability Context: </h2>
<hr style= "color:gold;">
	
	<div>
	<p>
Vulnerability concept frames the external environment in which people exist people's livelihood and why the availability of assets affected by critical trains as well as my shocks and seasonality- over which they have no control  .<br>
The factors that make up the vulnerability context important because they have a direct impact upon people's assets status and the options that are available to them in pursuit of beneficial rural Livelihoods outcomes.<br>
</p>

<hr style= "color:gold;">
<br>
</div>

<div>
	<p>
Shocks can destroy assets directly (  in the case of floods ,storms,civil conflict etc) it can also force people to dispose of assets such as land prematurely as part of coping strategies.<br>
Trends on the other hand may or may not be benign ,they are more predictable . They have a particularly important influence on rate of return economic or otherwise to a chosen livelihood strategy.<br>
Seasonal shifts in prices, employment opportunities and food availability<br>
	</p>
	
	
	
<div>
<p>
Natural Capital Is the term used for the natural resource stocks from which resource flows and services ( eg. nutrient cycling,erosion protection ) usefull for livelihoods are derived.There is a wide variation in the resources that make up natural capital,from intangible public goods such as the athmosphere and biodiversity to divisible assets uses directly for production ( trees,land,etc).<br>
Examples of Natural Capital and services deriving from it :Land, Forest,Marine/wild resources,water quality,air quality,erosion,wasteassimilation,storm,protection,Biodiversity degree and rate of change .<br>
</p>
</div>

<hr style= "color:gold;">
<h2>Human Capital</h2><br>
	
<div><p>
Human capital represent the skills,knowledge,ability to labour and good health that together enable people to pursue differnt livelihood strategies and achieve their livelihood objectives.Human appears in the generic framework <br>
as livelihood asset,that is a building block or means of achieving livelihood outcomes.But it accumulation can also be an end in itself<br>
</p>
<div>
	
<hr style= "color:gold;">
<h2>Social Capital:</h2>
<br>
	
	<div>
	<p>
In the context of the sustainable livelihood framework ,it is taken to mean the social resources from which people draw in pursuit of their livelihood  objectives .These are developed through <br>
Networks and Connectedness ,Membership of more formalized groups ,Relationships of trust,reciprocity and exchanges that faciltate co-operation,reduces transaction cost and may provide basis for informal safety net among the poor.<br>

<h2>2.2 <br>Sustainable Rural Livelihoods</h2>
<br>

<hr style= "color:gold;">
	<div>
<p>Rural areas are places that are not urban in nature ,that they are remote,with little economic activities and diversification....(  )<br>
The concept of Sustainable livelihoods is increasingly important in the development debate. <br>

This paper outlines a framework for analysing sustainable livelihoods, defined here in relation to five key indicators. <br>
The framework shows how, in different contexts, sustainable livelihoods are achieved through access to a range of livelihood resources (natural, economic, human and social capitals) which are combined in the pursuit of different livelihood strategies (agricultural intensification or extensification, livelihood diversification and migration).<mark>(Scoones Ian,IDS, 1998)</mark>
According to <mark>Koroma Ibrahim,July 2007,</mark>the term sustainable livelihood was first used as a development concept in the early 1990's .<br>
<mark>Chambers and Conway (IDS, 1992)</mark> stated that, "A livelihood comprises people, their capabilities and their means of living, including food, income and assets". <br>
Tangible assets are resources and stores, and intangible assets are claims and access. <br>
A livelihood is environmentally sustainable when it maintains or enhances the local and global assets on which livelihoods depend, and has net beneficial effects on other livelihoods.
<mark>Jah Mamoud ( Lawrence 1998) 2010)</mark> Defined livelihood as consisting of assets,activities and entitlement that enable people to make a  living.
</p>
</div>

<hr style= "color:gold;">
	
	
<h2>2.3 Common Property Resources </h2>

<div>
	
<p>According to <mark>Chambers ( 2000),</mark>he states, that "common property resources -CPRs are often a major source of livelihood for  the rural poor......safety nets and source of food and income in bad times."<br>
He refers to common property resources .....CPRs to include fishing ,hunting grounds ,grazing sites ,quarry etc. <br>
<mark>(Chambers 2000)</mark> also mentioned that," livelihood activities that are forest based or are diversified and supported by forest and woodlands...to livelihood activities especially be found through non-timber forest products (NTFPs)".<br>
NTFPs found in Kambui Hills forest reaerve are:  game,medicinal and culinary herbs ,insects ,leafy vegetables( wild variety) ,leaves ,nuts, fibre,etc<mark>( Researcher' Field Report )</mark><br>
</p>
</div>
<hr style= "color:gold;">

 <h2>2.4 <br>Protected Areas In Perspective.</h2>
 
 <hr style= "color:gold;">
 
<div>
 <p>
The practice of designating an area as a Protected Area (PA) or 'sanctuaries' reaches long back into the human psyche .<br>
The first PA were built by the Persians and were know in Greek as "Par a deisoi",from which the word 'paradise' has  evolved..<mark>(Strauss,,B.> ,2005).  </mark><mark>Salamis(Arrow,London).p45</mark><br>
The classical Greeks, also learnt to embrace  the values of nature <mark>("The love Of Nature Among The Greeks and Romans' ,Longmans,Londoon) )</mark><br>
From the Dark Ages to The Age of Enlightenment, throughout Europe vast areas of land were protected for the benefits of the nobility and the pursuits of hunting .<br>
<mark>(Pool,A(1954)from the Doomsday Book To The Magna Carta(Oxford University press ,Oxford 30-32))</mark>.<br>
In ancient Africa,it was common - especially amongst West African tribes ; partly due to their animalistic Religious /Spiritual beliefs- large areas of land and water-bodies were designated as 'Sacred' , 'no-go' areas.<br></p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
<p>Therefore in this light our African ancestors subconsciously practiced forest conservation , albeit for a different purpose.<br>
It was common amongst our West African ancestors to 'sacradize' certain hills,caves,groves,rivers ,springs and dedicate them to a Familiar spirit or ancestral totem.<br>
Sometimes referred to as 'evil-forest' ,these areas where only accessed by the clan's ; shamans,high priests,digbas,oracles and interstingly only the social outcasts of society ,had their homes there.<mark>( " Things Fall Apart " ,Chinua Achebe)</mark><br>
In this present century ,there has been four regional treaties for the creation of PAs in Africa,viz: 1900,1933,1968 and <mark>2003( Paparot Repor 2021)</mark><br>
	</p>
	<div>
<p>Since the 'Race for independence' from the 1950's to onwards,the top–down approach to  protected areas management and governance was inherited from the Colonialist.. <br>
: which often meant that States further centralized control<br>
,including power over natural resources and land tenure rights.<br>
<mark>(Büscher and Dietz, 2005; $oe et al,2009,Ribot,2002)</mark><br>
	

<div><p>Many African states therefore maintained ultimate control of PA governance through shortfalls in decentralization policies and rights to natural resources,<br>
even when responsibilities and deciaion making powers are meant to be shared or fully devolved to rural communities.(Murphee,2009: Nelson and Agrawa,2008;Ribot,2002)<br>

<h1>2.4.1 <br>Protected Areas with Sustainable Use of Natural Resource.:</h1>

<div>
<p>Biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation are two of the world's major challenges, and the search for synergies in the pursuit of both agendas is enshrined in their respective global policy frameworks – the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Sustainable  Development Goals.<br>
A protected area with sustainable use of natural resources or managed resource protected area is a protected area in which the aim is to protect and preserve biological diversity in the long term.<br>
The IUCN defines such areas as Category VI. <mark>(Wikipedia August 2021) </mark><br>
According to the IUCN, protected areas with sustainable use of natural resources are defined as areas that: "conserve ecosystems and habitats, together with associated cultural values and traditional natural resource management systems. <br>

<p>They are generally large, with most of the area in a natural condition, where a proportion is under sustainable natural resource management and where low-level non-industrial use of natural resources compatible with<br>
 nature conservation is seen as one of the main aims of the area.( Category VI - Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources Archived 2011-06-29 at the Wayback Machine at <mark>www.iucn.org Accessed on 11 Jun 2021.)</mark><br>
Generally speaking though, protected areas are understood to be those in which human presence or at least the exploitation of natural resources (e.g. firewood, non-timber forest products, water, ...) is limited.<mark>[Lele, Sharachchandra; Wilshusen, Peter; Brockington, Dan; Seidler, Reinmar; <br>
<mark>Bawa, Kamaljit (1 May 2010).</mark> <br>

 <h2> 2.5 <br>Ensuring Protected Areas and Rural Livelihoods Equillibrium. </h2>

<h2> 2.5.1<br> Alternative ,Adaptive and Coping Mechanisms </h2>

<div>
<p>
Alternative livelihoods can be defined as livelihood activities that supplement people’s basic income. These activities usually dependon people’s spare time, their skills, resources and art.<mark>(ILO Report, p.21 )</mark>
<br>
They include cocoa bi‐products production, palm oil processing, gari processing, vegetable farming,grasscutter rearing, mushroom production and bee keeping.<br>
Income from alternative livelihoods could lead to two possibilities. The gradualreplacement of the traditional livelihoods or part of the income generated by the alternativelivelihood <br>
is re‐invested in the traditional livelihood, such that coexistence of both approaches can be maintained. <br>
This coexistence can provide a buffer against climaticvariations and economic shocks, thus conferring stability and sustainability to rurallivelihoods. <br>
The mentioning of Alternative Livelihoods implicitly suggests several scenarios,namely; that prevailing livelihoods are either not producing enough benefits for theindividuals or communities engaged in them, or that current 
activities are in contraventionof existing legislations, or pose a danger to the sustainability of other resources. 
In thecontext of agriculture‐dominated economies, the resources at risk may be land, forest, orwater bodies.(  https://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/download.do?type=document&id=19775, September 11,2011)<br>
Alternative livelihoods are therefore thought of in the context of providinglivelihoods that may replace or supplement existing livelihoods that are in danger as a resultof resource constraints, or those livelihoods that do not generate sufficient incomes toenable those engaged in them live decent lives <mark>(Tropendos, 2005).</mark><br>
</p>
</div>

<br>
	<hr style= "color:gold;">
	
<h2>2.5.4 <br>Coping And Adaptive Strategies</h2>

<div>
<p>
Coping is conscious or unconscious strategies used to reduce unpleasant emotions. Coping strategies can be cognitions or behaviours and can be individual or social. WikipediaWeiten has identified four types of coping strategies: appraisal-focused (adaptive cognitive), problem-focused (adaptive behavioral), emotion-focused, and occupation-focused coping.Billings and Moos added avoidance coping as one of the emotion-focused coping.<br>
Some scholars have questioned the psychometric validity of forced categorisation as those strategies are not independent to each other.[wikipedia 2021 Coping Strategies] Besides, in reality, people can adopt multiple coping strategies simultaneously.<br>
</p>
</div>


<h2>2.5.2  <br>Sustainable Agriculture </h2>
<div>
<p>
Definition: <mark>Sustainable Agriculture </mark> is farming in sustainable ways meeting society's present food and textile needs, without compromising the ability for current or future generations to meet their needs.<br>
 It can be based on an understanding of ecosystem services. <br>
There are many methods to increase the sustainability of agriculture. <br>
When developing agriculture within sustainable food systems, it is important to develop flexible business process,infrastructures and farming practices.<br>
</p>
</div>

<h2>2.5.3 <br> Collaborative Forest Management </h2>

<div>
<p>Taking a conventional view of forest management, a broad distinction may be drawn between professional forest management as a ‘scientific’ discipline that enables states and nations to control<br>
, regulate and exploit forest resources under their jurisdiction; and indigenous forest management systems, developed locally by forest-dependent communities and varying greatly in technical and social sophistication.<br>
Collaborative Forest management it's Loosely defined as working relationship between  the key stake holders in the management of a given forest- key stakeholders being rural forest users and state forest departments, <br>
as well as parties such as Local governments,civic groups and non-governmental organizations and the private sector<mark>.( www.cifor.org/knowledge/publication/1791/ , 25 August,2021)</mark><br>
As has been widely documented, the new approach focussed initially on encouraging communities to regenerate patches of degraded forest land to produce a range of subsistence products. <br>
Support for these programmes often focussed excessively on community mobilisation, participatory tools and technical prescriptions. <br>
Gradually professional foresters recognised the ability of local people to contribute more conceptually to forest management and acknowledged their right to participate in many forest-related decisions (Arnold 2001).<br>
Approaches to involving local people in forestry have multiplied over the years.<br>
</p>
<div>
<p>
 These approaches include ;social forestry, community forestry, rural development forestry, joint forest management (JFM), shared forest management, co-management and participatory forest management, each of which tends to have a specific meaning <br>
and be associated with particular projects or programmes. All are essentially interventions, based to a varying extent on local people’s knowledge and wishes, but ‘legitimized and<br>
strengthened by government recognition’ (Ingles et al. 1999).<br>
  </p>
</div>
<hr style= "color:gold;">
	
<hr>
<h2>  2.5.5 <br>Cirular Economy </h2>
<hr>
	
<div>
<p>A Circular Economy (also referred to as "circularity") is "a model of production and consumption, which involves :sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling <br>
existing materials and products as long as possible"[3] that aims at tackling global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. <br>
It is defined in contradistinction to the traditional linear economy.
<mark>(  ^ Geissdoerfer, M., Pieroni, M.P., Pigosso, D.C. and Soufani, K. (2020). "Circular business models: A review" (PDF). Journal of Cleaner Production. 277: 123741. doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123741. S2CID 225282542. )</mark><br>
In a linear economy, natural resources are turned into products which are ultimately destined to become waste because of the way they have been designed and made. <br>
This process is often summarised by "take, make, waste".[4] ^ Brydges, Taylor (2021-04-15). "Closing the loop on take, make, waste: Investigating circular economy practices in the Swedish fashion industry". <br>
<mark>Journal of Cleaner Production. 293: 126245. doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.126245. ISSN 0959-6526.</mark><br>
</p>

<p>By contrast, a circular economy employ a circular economy employs reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling to create a closed-loop system, minimising the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste, pollution and carbon emissions.
<mark>Geissdoerfer, Martin; Savaget, Paulo; Bocken, Nancy M. P.; Hultink, Erik Jan (2017-02-01). "The Circular Economy – A new sustainability paradigm?". Journal of Cleaner Production. 143: 757–768. </mark><br>
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) defines the circular economy as an industrial economy that is restorative or regenerative by design and aims.<br>

<div>
	
<p>Initiated by former Ecover CEO and Belgian entrepreneur Gunter Pauli,
 derived from the study of natural biological production processes the official manifesto states,<br>
 "using the resources available...the waste of one product becomes the input to create a new cash flow".<br>

 <h2>2.5.7  <br>Cradle to Cradle </h2>
 <hr style= "color:gold;">

<div><div>
Created by Walter R. Stahel and similar theorists, in which industry adopts the reuse and service-life extension of goods as a strategy of <br>
 waste prevention, regional job creation, and resource efficiency in order to decouple wealth from resource consumption.<br>
