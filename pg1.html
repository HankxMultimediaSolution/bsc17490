<h2> 1.1 <br>BACKGROUND </h2>
<br><br><br>
	
<div><p>
 Protected areas have emerged as major arenas of disputes concerning both rural <br>
livelihoods and environmental protection , and as the main hope for the imperilled biota <br>
of  Sierra Leone.</p></div>
<br><br><br>

<div>
<p>
The ecological equilibrium,integrity and stability of our natural biodiversity requires <br>
sincere of the sustenance,needs and economic aspirations of the rural people <br>
livelihood activities in tandem with sustainable forest management. ()<br></p>
	</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
	
	<div><p>
The earth was once a beautiful,' green ' planet ; full of life and biodiversity. <br>
But ever since the  industrial revolution:mankind's livelihood activities <br>
has slowly but surely depleted the natural resource base,polluted water sources, and introduced toxic <br>
gases into the once pure athmosphere at an unprecedented rate and <br>
amount,degraded and fragmented natural habitats and disrupted the equilibrium of <br>
the once stable natural ecosystems.<mark>(Our Common Future,1989)</mark>
<br>
</p> </div>
<br><br><br>
	
<div>
<p>According to a study by carried out by the <mark>Ellen Macarthur's Foundation,</mark>"The <br>
overexploitation of  the natural resource base is as a result of the linear model of production and <br>
consumption practices adopted by both industries and consumers alike. <br>
The  aforementioned organization advocates for a Circular-Economy / 'Blue' Economy <br>
Model of production and consumption this essentially based on the principles of sustainable economic development <mark>( Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Report , 2013; Wikipedia 2013)</mark><br>
</p>
<br><br><br>
</div>
<div>
It is   mainly due to the aforementioned devastating phenomenon; inorder to curb and buffer the the negative impacts of rural livelihoods activities  on th environment (primary forests) and<br>
 consequently on the wellbeing of rural people- ": geographic areas;terrestrial,marine etc where set aside as Reserves and Protected areas"<mark>(IUCN Report;Wikipedia)</mark>.
 these areas are generally known as protected areas (PAs)<mark>( Jimmy Mariama, 2012).<mark><br>
</div>
</div>

<br><br><br>

<div><p>
The prevalence of state governed PAs originates from Africa's colonial past as the <br>
first African PAs were created starting in the mid 1920s and 1930s ,when the <br>
power to govern these was firmly vested in the State <mark>(Papaco Report, IUCN p.1)</mark><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<br><br><br>
	
<div><p>
Ever since the ' Race For Independence ' ; 
the Top-Down approach  tob PAs management was inherited which often meant that states centralized control,<br>
access to natural resources and land tenure rights<mark> ( Büscher and Dietz, 2005; Roe et al,2009,Ribot ,2002).</mark>
Excluding rural communities from the management and policy formulation  ,<br>
project planning phase can have a negative impacts on yhe effective  management of  protected areas <mark>( Kothari,200.Sowmern et al, 2011)</mark><br>
Due to the alarming  rate of desertification in the Sahel Belt- with the Sahara Desert 'creeping ' towards the equator -<br></p>
 

<p>The 'Green Belt Programme' was initiated<mark> (Deutsche Welle Documentary)</mark>=<br>
which is essentially .a massive conservation effort:with the aim of not only protecting the environment<br>
  but also providing 'green-jobs' for the massively unemployed youths population in the Sahel region.<mark>(Janani ,Vivekanada,Deutsche  wèlle, 2019).</mark>
Historically Sierra Leone was covered  by 70% primary forest<mark>(Forestry Division Archives)</mark>
</p>

<p>Since the inception of Sierra leone Forestry Department Act in 1911, <br>
the department was mandated  with the responsibility  of  setting up forest ordinances;protected areas, 
forest reserve,game–reserves,national parks, game parks and wildlife sanctuaries in order to protect wildlife  
and plant species<mark>(Forestry Division  Archives)</mark>.</p>

<p><mark>The 1972 wildlife  conservation Act of Sierra Leone </marked>governed "the exploitation of wildlife and provided legal protection 
rights for those  endangered species". ( )</p>

<p>The Forest Act 1988 reinforces the Wildlife Conservation Act and focuses on the utility and management  
of forest resources and allowed  for the  participation 
of local communities in forest resources  management<mark>( Mamoud Jah 2011) </mark>.
</p>

<p>Moreover Sierra Leone  is a signatory to the international Conservation  of  Biological Diversity and the Ramsar Conservation <mark> ( Sierra Leone Conservation  and Wildlife Policy, 2010).</mark>
Therefore so far it can be safely concluded that  there  exists both locally  and internationally  the legal framework  and institutions for protected area management  and conservation  .
The only aspect  lacking is the proper implementation and follow_up on such policies <mark>(EPA-SL Report, 2020)</mark></p>
</div>


<hr>
<h2>1.2  <br>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </h2>
<hr>
	
<div><p>
The survival of mankind depends to a very large extent on the natural capital available to us,for the provisioning of the basic necessities for life such as: food,fibre(clothing) ,shelter,that will ensuure the humankind's overall wellbeing<mark> (Content, 2012).</mark>
Not only the availability of such natural capital is important but also the fair access and control is also crucial .<mark>( Mr Sesay Lecture Notes )</mark><br>
Due to the rapid increase in population and the resulting increased rate of deforestation and urbanization -<br>
 the natural capital available to the rural man is being exploited at a faster rate;above its threshold for recovery by natural processes alone.<mark>("How To Avoid A Climate Disaster ",Bill Gates)</mark>.<br>
It is because of these grim event that holistic conservative and sustainable forest management practices and principles must be adopted and incorporated into National,regional and<br>
local policies governing protected areas and their management.<br>
</p></div>

<div><p>
 Generally environmental impact assessment in Sierra. Leone is very weak despite the high proportion. of the population is engaged in logging,mining and agricultural livelihood activities (Komrabai, 2012).
Personally I think that the extent of deforestation, biodiversity degradation sand fragmentation, air pollution, water shed and bodies depletionand pollution is under reported, down played ( either because of the influence of politics in research or other unforeseen reasons).Therefore the negative. impacts on KHFR are not tackled holistically ; using a multi-sectoral,multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach. Therefore at best existing policies are not appropriately and sustainably implemented,and consistent  follow up, monitoring and proper evaluation is lacking. 
Whilst previous researchers;  Komrabai,Jimmy , Conteh focused more on the ecological aspects of Protected   areas and the destruction of the natural ecosystems thereby paying less attention to the cultural, socioeconomic inter relationships and inter linkages between rural livelihood activities and the ecology of the protected areas and its environs. A study of this nature is a prerequisite for establishing a robust baseline from which future conservation efforts can be developed: by providing an unadulterated perspective on the current ecological status , and trends in the Kambui Hills Forest Reserve , whilst at the same time showing interlinkages to the sustainable livelihoods approach framework( DFID, 1998)
</p></div>

<hr>
<h2>1.3 <br>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</h2>
<hr>

<div>
<p>
The main AIM of this study : <br>
Is to investigate the negative impacts of rural livelihood activities on the ecological  equilibria on protected areas , <br>
specifically Kambui Hills Forest Reserve and how in turn the anthropogenically modified environment <br>
impacts rural livelihood activities and wellfare ,<br>
whilst examining the inter-linkages and inter-relationships between <br>
rural livelihood activities with respect to PAs based upon "The Sustainable Livelihood Approach Framework"<mark> (DFID 1999).</mark><br>
</p>
</div>

<hr>
<h2>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:</h2>
<hr>
	
<div>
<p>
	<ol>
<li>Examine the socio-economic and demographic status of the respondents,influencing the natural integrity of the aforementioned protected area.</li>
<li>Examine the rural livelihood activities that disrupts this ecological balance and harmony.</li>
<li>Investigate how the damaged ecosystem of the Kambui Hills Forest Reserve affects the wellbeing of the rural people.</li>
<li>Show interlinkages and relationships between rural livelihood activities and the ecological status and integrity of <br>
The Kambui Hills Forest Reserve based on 'The Sustainable Livelihood Approach Framework (DFID 1998.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</div>

<hr>
<h2>1.4 <br>JUSTIFICATION FOR STUDY </h2>
<hr>
	
	<div><p>
A study of this nature is required to establish a robust baseline , <br>
from which future policies concerning Conservation and sustainable use<br>
 and management of protected areas can be developed.<br>
 	</p>
 
<p>Also amongst all the protected areas within Sierra Leone; up-to-date information on the <br>
 present ecological status of the Kambui Hills Forest Reserve is lacking.<br>
Therefore this study is carried out inorder to serve as an update to preexisting knowledge as <br>
the destruction of the natural resource base is a continuous cycle and happens at an ever increasing <br>
rate due to over population and the demands of agriculture and urbanisation.<br>
</p>

<h2>1.7 <br>LIMITATIONS OF STUDY</h2>
<hr>
	
	<div>
<p>
This study was face with certain challenges, such as ;<br>
	<ol>
<li>Identifying the age of the respondents owing to the fact that most of the respondents were illiterate and did not keep documented records of</li> <br>
their respective dates of birth,nevertheless this issue <br>
was tackled throughgh a strategy _ wherein the given ages we're correlated to the historical hallmarks ; such as <br>
The appearance of the first aeroplane in Sierra Leone ie in 1939.<br>
<ul>
<li>The Second World War 1945
<li>National Independence day( 1961)
<li>Visitation of H.M Queen Elizabeth
</ul>

<p><li>This study focuses mainly on the exploitation by rural livelihood activities on the Kambui Hills Forest Reserve's primarily by rural people  </li><br>
of Tissoh Community for their respective livelihood outcomes,whilst not focusing on external actors such as ;private companies <br>
-both national and international, private investors and entrepreneurs whom are based in urban areas- that exploit KHFR on a much more larger scale than the rural poor , <br>
because these investors and multnational companies have access to large capital for investment and heavy duty  machinery that are in contrast to the manual labour that is employed by the rural poor. </p>

<p><li>This study was limited to semi structured questionnaire, recording schedule, direct observation and schedule audio recordings.<br></li>
<li>Not also overlooking the inherent human bias of the aurthor in interpreting some qualitative data-</li>
 <br>though the researcher tried Hu is best to be as objective as possible.</li><br>
<li>Interpreters was used in some cases of language barriers ,<br>
 which may lead to certain linguistic nuances and concepts to be misinterpreted of over generalized.<br></li>
</p>

<h2>1.8<br> DEFINITION OF TERMS</h2>
<hr>
	
	<div>
<p>
	<ol>
<li><mark>Assets </mark> :They word is not used here in the strictest economic sense but rather as a means to achieving rural livelihood outcomes.<br></li>
<li><mark>Livelihood </mark> : a set of activities that people engage in to secure wellfare and wellbeing .<br></li>
<li><mark>Natural Capital  </mark> :Is the term used for the natural resource stocks from which resource flows and services <br></li>
( eg. nutrient cycling,erosion protection ) usefull for livelihoods are derived.<br></li>
<li><mark>Rural areas :</mark>are places that are not urban in nature ,that they are remote,with little economic activities and diversification....(  )<br>
