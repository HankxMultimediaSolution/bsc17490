<h1> CHAPTER 5  </h1>
 
 
<h2>SUMMARY CONCLUSION RECOMMENDATION </h2>

<hr>
<h2>5.1 SUMMARY  </h2>
<hr>
Durings the course of this study local,diverse respondents were interviewed and their unique perception of Proteced areas and rural livelihoods interlinkages were taken into account  ,complimented by the author's first hand observation and invsetigation.
It was evident  throuhout the study of the negative impact that rural livelihoods has directly on the environment and natural resource base, <br>
specifically;Rock Mining ,deforestation.<br><br><br>

<hr>
<h2>5.2 CONCLUSIONS </h2>
<hr>
Unless drastic acrion is taken by local stakeholders,NGOs and the Government of boost agricultural productivity eg through subsidies and cash incentives to these rural farmers the overall foodsecurity is will remain fragile.<br>
The study reconfirms that major charcoal and woodfuel producers communities lie along Kenema -Kono High way along the KHFR. This is to be expected as the highways act as strategic locations from which to sell <br>
and transport charcoal to buyers from Kono, Kenema, Bo and other urban centres around the country. The cost and effort of involved in transporting charcoal from more remote sites would likely be prohibitive. <br>
Furthermore, unlike with boards where chainsaw operators will venture deeper into the forest or to remote villages to seek out specific valuable tree species, charcoal makers tend to be more flexible in terms of what tree species they use and therefore mainly operate close to villages and major highways.<br>
 In terms of the forest cover impacts of charcoal production the Kenema-Kono highway, the map is inconclusive.<br>

<hr><br>
 <p>
As mentioned before, this is an area of high anthropogenic activity (urbanisation, agriculture, other wood-based production) and it is difficult to pinpoint which, if any, one activity has the greatest impact on forest loss.  <br>
Once again, as with board producing sites, there is no evidence of higher concentrations of forest loss around <br>
The landscape of the area surrounding KHNFR has been highly dynamic over the past decade, with myriad patches of gain and loss in the various vegetation categories. <br>
The forest reserve itself appears to have remained reasonably intact with only a thin line of forest reduction along its (mainly eastern) fringes, while the entire area surrounding the reserve as a whole appears to have experienced a modest overall increase in forest, or at least dense vegetative, cover. <br>
This contrasts strongly with usual environmental narratives in Sierra  Leone, which present the country‟s forest cover as being in a state of constant and/or rapid decline. <br>
The analysis has shown that there is a specific geography of forest and other vegetation change in the area, which has largely been a product of urban expansion on the edges of Kenema and in towns along the Kenema-Kono Highway. <br>
Overall the bulk of forest lost has occurred to the east and south of the KHNFR. Overall, it appears that the main factors affecting forest cover in the KHNFR area have been the related processes of population displacement/migration and urbanisation, while “bush” gain and loss patterns (as well as the overall ecological patchiness of the landscape) seem to be largely associated with the dynamics of the fallow agricultural system.<br>
	</p>

Charcoal producing villages along the Kenena-Kono highway. Interestingly, however, the medium-scale charcoal producing villages along the Bo-Kenema highway, which are located nearer to <br>
 areas indicated to be  experiencing forest gain, suggesting that charcoal production in these villages, at least at the current scale, have had no major negative impact on their surrounding forest cover.<br>
 
 
 
 
<h1>5.3
RECOMMENDATIONS </h1>


<p>
Decisions concerning forest land management at the farm level are important for the present and future status of land resources. <br>
Sustainable Land Management (SLM) requires the ability to monitor changes in agro-ecosystems health: these should be given due priority in policy .<br>
Therefore agriculture extension service that will educate,train rural farmers in the latest scientific sustainable agriculture and agro forestry best practices<br><br>
The  extensive gully erosion and mass wasting situation in Tissoh Community  , intensive fertiliser recommendation system is unfit to help Tissoh farmers in their fertilising practice. <br><br>
The aim of the prefered system has been to apply the lowest possible NPK rates required to achieve safe and high yields as well …<br><br>
Some scholars have analyzed the diversification of rural livelihoods, which focused on the selection of … a series of policy instruments that not only consider rural livelihood strategies in the short term economic growth projections.<br><br>
Therefore in this light social financial services such as short tem loans and micro credit  services and agricultural subsidy and incentives should be provided by the GOSL and development  partners.<br><br>
Communual land should be designed, allocated  and implemented so that it can greatly contribute to their livelihoods … equity and . <br><br>
Gender is an integral a inseparable Part of rural livelihood because, and women have different …Therefore Tissoh's women folks should be empowered and allow to own and access larger communual land as their own private plots.In order to ensure they grow permanent cash crops.<br><br>
Further research should be done on As a comparative study amongst the communities adjacent to KHFR .<br><br>
More research should be done on " Communual Rural Lands versus Sustainable Development.<br>
